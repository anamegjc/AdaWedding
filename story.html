      <h3>Adaeze's Story</h3>
      <p>Towards the end of 2021, I rejoined Twitter while preparing my graduate school applications. I wanted to connect with people in academia, so I started following PhD students, graduates, and a few Igbo handles to build friendships with other Igbo speakers as well. Somewhere along the way, I connected with Okezie (though to this day, we still debate who followed who first üòâ).</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">For months, we were just mutuals ‚Äì occasionally liking or commenting on each other's tweets but nothing more. Around that same time, I noticed he was also part of an online Catholic rosary space I joined regularly. Catholics from around the world would gather there daily to pray. I would see his name pop up often, but I didn't think much of it. Little did I know, he already had plans to reach out.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">Then, in early 2022 during the Hallelujah Challenge, I got a message from him on Twitter. It simply said that he hadn't realized I was Catholic ‚Äì and then he wished me goodnight. To be honest, I was caught off guard! I expected a more traditional 'Hi, my name is‚Ä¶' introduction. I didn't respond right away, but by the next morning I replied, mentioning that I often saw him in the rosary space. That small exchange turned into ongoing conversations, and soon we had built a genuine friendship.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">From 2022 to mid-2024, our friendship grew beautifully. During this time, Okezie would occasionally express that he hoped for something more, but I wasn't ready. I had just started my PhD and wasn't looking for any distractions. Still, our friendship remained strong and meaningful.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">In August 2024, he shared his feelings again, this time more earnestly. I decided to take it to prayer, asking God for clarity. I didn't want to miss out on a blessing because of hesitation. So, I prayed ‚Äì and so did he. Not long after, we talked, and I told him I was ready to give us a chance. From there, we began courting, and a few months later, in April 2025, he proposed.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">Now, here we are ‚Äì planning our forever together. üíç‚ú®</p>

      <h3>Okezie's Story</h3>
      <p>Believe it or not, Ada and I met on Twitter of all places! We first crossed paths in a Rosary prayer space hosted by a Nigerian priest. After seeing her a few times, I decided to send her a DM (in what she'll probably say was the most unexpected way). Looking back, I'm so glad I did because it has led us to this point!</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">What started as casual conversations turned into a meaningful friendship. Over the next 3-ish years, that friendship grew stronger, and somewhere along the way, we became best friends.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">I'll admit, I knew early on that there was something special about Ada. I had already fallen for her, even before she realized it. But love has its own timing, and I'm grateful we found our way to each other.</p>
